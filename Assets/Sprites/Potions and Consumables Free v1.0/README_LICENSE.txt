Hello, thank you for downloading the pack! This file serves as a reference for the usage terms, link to the itch page, and general information.


** What's included in the pack? **
Lots of 16x16 potions (scaled 32x32 and 48x48 included), less than I have planned but still a lot. If you donate you can also download the the extras which currently only includes one extra basic potion sheet, the color palette, and a merged sheet that contains all of the free sheets + the extra.
